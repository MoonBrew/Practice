# Practice
Place where I do practice problems

Check out my notes on current problem I am working on: [Euler 254](https://github.com/MoonBrew/Practice/wiki/Euler-254)

I started the HtC1 on the OSSU course and realised how important its to write clear code with tests. Gonna redo Euler with tests when I can.
