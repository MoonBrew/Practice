# Practice
Place where I do practice problems

Check out my notes on problems that I am working on:
- [Euler 254](https://github.com/MoonBrew/Practice/wiki/Euler-254)
- [Morse](https://github.com/MoonBrew/Practice/wiki/Morse-conversion-from-Hackajob)
- [Permutations](https://github.com/MoonBrew/Practice/wiki/Permutations)

I started the HtC1 on the OSSU course and realised how important its to write clear code with tests. Gonna redo Euler with tests when I can.
